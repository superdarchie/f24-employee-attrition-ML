## Overview

This repository is a group project for "Machine Learning for Business Decision Making" at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, taken during Fall '24.

For a company worried about employee attrition/burnout (employees leaving the company), we iteratively created a model that predicts whether employees are likely to resign based on a dataset collected by the human resources department.

The ML models are trained on the "attrition_available_26.pkl" dataset and make predictions using "attrition_compet_26.pkl".

### Parts 1 & 2

The purpose of the first part is to practice with basic and advanced machine learning methods, featuring exploratory data analysis (EDA), holdout validation (train/test split), cross-validation, and hyper-parameter optimization (HPO).
We implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and XGBoost, then identified XGBoost as our most optimal model with a classification accuracy near 95%.

The second part expands on the XGBoost model, incorporating feature selection and HPO to improve results further.
